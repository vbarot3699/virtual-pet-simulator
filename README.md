Virtual Pet Simulator

Welcome to the Simulator of Virtual Pets! With the help of this C# console program, users may engage with a virtual pet by carrying out different tasks to keep it healthy.

Project Specifications

1. Pet Creation: Let the user name and select a type of pet (such as a dog, cat, or rabbit).
- Show a greeting including the name and type of the pet.

2. Animal Care Measures
- Put into practice measures like:
  - Feeding: Reduces hunger and marginally improves health.
  Playing: Slightly increases appetite, but enhances happiness.
  - Resting: Enhances well-being, but somewhat lowers happiness.
- Every action need to update the pet's data appropriately and show a message outlining the outcome.

3. Pet Status Monitoring - Monitor and show your pet's health, happiness, and hunger on a scale of 1 to 10.
- Provide a status check that alerts the user to any stats that are abnormally high or low.

4. Time-Based Changes: These modifications simulate the passage of time, with each action denoting an hour.
- Over time, contentment gradually declines and hunger rises, leading to frequent social engagement.

5. Enhanced Interaction Logic - Apply penalties for disregard, such a decline in health if the animal is too sad or hungry.
- Depending on the pet's condition, add notes or unique occurrences (e.g., the pet refusing to play if too hungry).

6. Experience and User Interface
- Create a terminal interface that is easy to use, straightforward, and clear.
- Provide the user with instructions on how to use the program.
